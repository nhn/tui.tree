## v4.0.0 Migration Guide

### Remove jQuery

In v4.0.0, jQuery is removed. It might cause some errors if you pass a jQuery object as a `container`.

Previously, you can use a `jQueryObject` to create an instance.

```javascript
// v3
const tree = new Tree($('#tree'), options);
```

Now, you have to use `selector` or `HTMLElement` as a `container`.

```javascript
// v4
const tree = new Tree('#tree', options);

// or

const container = document.getElementById('tree');
const tree = new Tree(container, options);
```

### Use the selector, not id selector

When a string is passed into a `container`, it was considered as the **id of the container** in v3. Now, it is considered as the **selector**.

```javascript
// v3
const tree = new Tree('tree', options);

// v4
const tree = new Tree('#tree', options);
```

### Change Ajax feature options

By replacing the Ajax module (jQuery.ajax() -> [tui-code-snippet/ajax](https://nhn.github.io/tui.code-snippet/2.3.0/ajax)), some options changed their names and some are removed.

* `command[type].type` -> `command[type].method`: The method of the Ajax request
* `command[type].dataType` -> `command[type].contentType`: The media type of the resource ([MDN reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type))
* `command[type].jsonpCallback` -> removed
* `command[type].data` -> `command[type].params`: The parameters to be sent by the Ajax request
